Sandbox for working on OpenLaszlo RIA apps for an model of web resource
annotations.  Initially these are stored as Wagn cards and accessed via XML
using an experimental XML interface to Wagn.

cardtest.lzx    First test app, scrollable window to app in:
cardlist.lzx    Data sources and a display class for query and cardlists (use <list> instead)
getnote.lzs     Script code to search the returned XML, turn it into local XML
cardview.lzx    View for a single card
wagnxml.lzx     External request (Wagn cards) code
cc.lzx          Simple test to validate app window part
./air/build.sh  Build as a AIR app (with 'test' as argument to run it locally)

You have to start the OpenLaszlo server first to access as a web app.  And have the code installed in the 'my-apps' directory of the server.  Then you access
with:  http://127.0.0.1:8080/lps-4.3.0/my-apps/cardtest.lzx
